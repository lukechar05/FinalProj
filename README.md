## Introduction 
In this project our group was tasked with analyzing WPRDC datasets to figure out the best burrow in Pittsburgh. In order to do this we needed to generate a metric that we believed could classify a neighborhood as the "best". Each group member could then work on complementary datasets to create this metric. To come up with this important statistic we met as a group and identified some attributes we loved about the places we live. At first we thought of characteristics like a solid education system, gothic architecture, and large voting participation from the populous in local elections. However, we soon came to a consensus and realized there a few neighborhood qualities that mean way more to us. Among these were parks and natural beauty, a safe and well protected community, and minimal taxation. 


## Metric
The metric that we decided upon, for determining the best neighborhood to live in, within Pittsburgh, is the numeric comparisons of the least amount of violent crimes, the most amount of parks, and the most amount of tax delinquency. We decided least amount of violent crimes, due to violent crimes being extremely unwanted in an ideal neighborhood, especially if you are attempting to raise a family. Additionally, we chose the most amount of parks, because having more parks, is better for raising a family, as they are public and safe places for families to have fun. Oddly, we picked most amount of tax delinquency, because we believe that taxation is theft, and more often than not, the rich are able to avoid taxes, and with rich people comes protection, such as the mob.


## Conclusion 
After parsing the park data and generating a bar graph visualization it was clear that some neighborhoods had significantly more natural beauties and parks than others. Southside slopes and beach view each had the most parks.
